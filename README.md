# SnowfallKeyPress

This addon speeds up key bindings by making them activate on key press instead of key release. This lets you use your abilities faster than usual, which can be crucial in high-reaction situations. In such cases, the addon can feel like reducing your latency by 100ms. The exact impact depends on how much time you typically take between pressing and releasing a key.
*Compatible with WoTLK 3.3.5*
